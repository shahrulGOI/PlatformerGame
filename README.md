# PlatformerGame
This is my first attempt at making a game using Unity Engine. 

This is a 3D platformer game that has the exact same concept at pacman but in 3d and some twist. Objectives are the same, with the only challenge being to finish the game fast. There are respawn points as well as objects to help cross over walls to help escape the enemy. 
The enemy that is in the game uses an built in pathfinding algorithm to find the best path to chase and down the player and kill the enemy.

Unfortunately, Due to the size of the game (Assets, Library, Obj, etc) the game file was not able to be uploaded.
